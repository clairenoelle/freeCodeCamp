# Connect Redux to React

The code editor has the mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions and a new React component called Presentational. Connect this component to Redux with the connect method from the ReactRedux global object, and call it immediately on the Presentational component. Assign the result to a new const called ConnectedComponent that represents the connected component. That's it, now you're connected to Redux! Try changing either of connect's arguments to null and observe the test results.



# Connect Redux to the Messages App

The code editor has all the code you've written in this section so far. The only change is that the React component is renamed to Presentational. Create a new component held in a constant called Container that uses connect to connect the Presentational component to Redux. Then, in the AppWrapper, render the React Redux Provider component. Pass Provider the Redux store as a prop and render Container as a child. Once everything is setup, you will see the messages app rendered to the page again.



# Extract Local State into Redux

In the Presentational component, first, remove the messages property in the local state. These messages will be managed by Redux. Next, modify the submitMessage() method so that it dispatches submitNewMessage() from this.props, and pass in the current message input from local state as an argument. Because you removed messages from local state, remove the messages property from the call to this.setState() here as well. Finally, modify the render() method so that it maps over the messages received from props rather than state.



# Extract State Logic to Redux

First, define an action type 'ADD' and set it to a const ADD. Next, define an action creator addMessage() which creates the action to add a message. You'll need to pass a message to this action creator and include the message in the returned action.

Then create a reducer called messageReducer() that handles the state for the messages. The initial state should equal an empty array. This reducer should add a message to the array of messages held in state, or return the current state. Finally, create your Redux store and pass it the reducer.



# Getting Started with React Redux

Start with a DisplayMessages component. Add a constructor to this component and initialize it with a state that has two properties: input, that's set to an empty string, and messages, that's set to an empty array.



# Manage State Locally First

First, in the render() method, have the component render an input element, button element, and ul element. When the input element changes, it should trigger a handleChange() method. Also, the input element should render the value of input that's in the component's state. The button element should trigger a submitMessage() method when it's clicked.

Second, write these two methods. The handleChange() method should update the input with what the user is typing. The submitMessage() method should concatenate the current message (stored in input) to the messages array in local state, and clear the value of the input.

Finally, use the ul to map over the array of messages and render it to the screen as a list of li elements.



# Map Dispatch to Props

The code editor provides an action creator called addMessage(). Write the function mapDispatchToProps() that takes dispatch as an argument, then returns an object. The object should have a property submitNewMessage set to the dispatch function, which takes a parameter for the new message to add when it dispatches addMessage().



# Map State to Props

Create a function mapStateToProps(). This function should take state as an argument, then return an object which maps that state to specific property names. These properties will become accessible to your component via props. Since this example keeps the entire state of the app in a single array, you can pass that entire state to your component. Create a property messages in the object that's being returned, and set it to state.



# Moving Forward From Here

Log the message 'Now I know React and Redux!' to the console.



# Use Provider to Connect Redux to React

The code editor now shows all your Redux and React code from the past several challenges. It includes the Redux store, actions, and the DisplayMessages component. The only new piece is the AppWrapper component at the bottom. Use this top level component to render the Provider from ReactRedux, and pass the Redux store as a prop. Then render the DisplayMessages component as a child. Once you are finished, you should see your React component rendered to the page.
