# Add Elements within Your Bootstrap Wells

Nest three button elements within each of your well div elements.



# Add Font Awesome Icons to all of our Buttons

Use Font Awesome to add an info-circle icon to your info button and a trash icon to your delete button.



# Add Font Awesome Icons to our Buttons

Use Font Awesome to add a thumbs-up icon to your like button by giving it an i element with the classes fa and fa-thumbs-up; make sure to keep the text "Like" next to the icon.



# Add id Attributes to Bootstrap Elements

Give the well on the left the id of left-well. Give the well on the right the id of right-well.



# Apply the Default Bootstrap Button Style

Apply both the btn and btn-default classes to each of your button elements.



# Call out Optional Actions with btn-info

Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your "Like" button with the text "Info", and add Bootstrap's btn-info and btn-block classes to it.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.



# Center Text with Bootstrap

Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element.

Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them with a space, like this:

<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>



# Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button

Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button.



# Create a Bootstrap Button

Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.

Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the btn and btn-default classes, as well as the text of "Like".



# Create a Bootstrap Headline

To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.



# Create a Bootstrap Row

Create a div element below the h3 tag, with a class of row.



# Create a Class to Target with jQuery Selectors

Give each of your button elements the class target.



# Create a Custom Heading

Nest your first image and your h2 element within a single <div class="row"> element. Nest your h2 element within a <div class="col-xs-8"> and your image in a <div class="col-xs-4"> so that they are on the same line.



# Create Bootstrap Wells

Nest one div element with the class well within each of your col-xs-6 div elements.



# Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap

Delete the .red-text, p, and .smaller-image CSS declarations from your style element so that the only declarations left in your style element are h2 and thick-green-border.

Then delete the p element that contains a dead link. Then remove the red-text class from your h2 element and replace it with the text-primary Bootstrap class.

Finally, remove the "smaller-image" class from your first img element and replace it with the img-responsive class.



# Give Each Element a Unique id

Give each of your buttons a unique id, starting with target1 and ending with target6.

Make sure that target1 to target3 are in #left-well, and target4 to target6 are in #right-well.



# House our page within a Bootstrap container-fluid div

Let's nest your h3 element within a div element with the class container-fluid.



# Label Bootstrap Buttons

Give each of your button elements text that corresponds to its id's selector.



# Label Bootstrap Wells

Above your left-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #left-well.

Above your right-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #right-well.



# Line up Form Elements Responsively with Bootstrap

Nest both your form's text input and submit button within a div with the class row. Nest your form's text input within a div with the class of col-xs-7. Nest your form's submit button in a div with the class col-xs-5.



# Make Images Mobile Responsive

First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.



# Responsively Style Checkboxes

Nest all three of your checkboxes in a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them in a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.



# Responsively Style Radio Buttons

Nest both your radio buttons within a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them within a <div class="col-xs-6"> element.



# Split Your Bootstrap Row

Create two div elements within your row, both with the class col-xs-6.



# Style Text Inputs as Form Controls

Give your form's text input field a class of form-control. Give your form's submit button the classes btn btn-primary. Also give this button the Font Awesome icon of fa-paper-plane.

All textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements with the class .form-control have a width of 100%.



# Taste the Bootstrap Button Color Rainbow

Replace Bootstrap's btn-default class by btn-primary in your button.

Note that this button will still need the btn and btn-block classes.



# Use a span to Target Inline Elements

Nest the word "love" in your "Things cats love" element below within a span element. Then give that span the class text-danger to make the text red.



# Use Comments to Clarify Code

Add a comment at the top of your HTML that says Only change code above this line.




# Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers

To get started, we should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with the class container-fluid.



# Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side

Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.

The row class is applied to a div, and the buttons themselves can be nested within it.



# Warn Your Users of a Dangerous Action with btn-danger

Create a button with the text "Delete" and give it the class btn-danger.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.
