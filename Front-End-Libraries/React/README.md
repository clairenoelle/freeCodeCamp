# Create a Simple JSX Element

The current code uses JSX to assign a div element to the constant JSX. Replace the div with an h1 element and add the text Hello JSX! inside it.



# Create a Complex JSX Element

Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains the following elements in order:

An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li items. You can include any text you want within each element.



# Add Comments in JSX

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.



# Render HTML Elements to the DOM

The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page. You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.



# Define an HTML Class in JSX

Apply a class of myDiv to the div provided in the JSX code.



# Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags

Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don't change any of the content - you only need to close tags where they are needed.



# Create a Stateless Functional Component

The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.



# Create a React Component

MyComponent is defined in the code editor using class syntax. Finish writing the render method so it returns a div element that contains an h1 with the text Hello React!.



# Create a Component with Composition

In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a React component called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent within the ParentComponent. Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash.



# Use React to Render Nested Components

There are two functional components defined in the code editor, called TypesOfFruit and Fruits. Take the TypesOfFruit component and compose it, or nest it, within the Fruits component. Then take the Fruits component and nest it within the TypesOfFood component. The result should be a child component, nested within a parent component, which is nested within a parent component of its own!



# Compose React Components

Nest two components inside of Fruits â€” first NonCitrus, and then Citrus. Both of these components are provided for you in the background. Next, nest the Fruits class component into the TypesOfFood component, below the h1 header and above Vegetables. The result should be a series of nested components, which uses two different component types.



# Render a Class Component to the DOM

Both the Fruits and Vegetables components are defined for you behind the scenes. Render both components as children of the TypesOfFood component, then render TypesOfFood to the DOM. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.



# Write a React Component from Scratch

Define a class MyComponent that extends React.Component. Its render method should return a div that contains an h1 tag with the text: My First React Component! in it. Use this text exactly, the case and punctuation matter. Make sure to call the constructor for your component, too.

Render this component to the DOM using ReactDOM.render(). There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.



# Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component

There are Calendar and CurrentDate components in the code editor. When rendering CurrentDate from the Calendar component, pass in a property of date assigned to the current date from JavaScript's Date object. Then access this prop in the CurrentDate component, showing its value within the p tags. Note that for prop values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets, for instance date={Date()}



# Pass an Array as Props

There are List and ToDo components in the code editor. When rendering each List from the ToDo component, pass in a tasks property assigned to an array of to-do tasks, for example ["walk dog", "workout"]. Then access this tasks array in the List component, showing its value within the p element. Use join(", ") to display the props.tasksarray in the p element as a comma separated list. Today's list should have at least 2 tasks and tomorrow's should have at least 3 tasks.
