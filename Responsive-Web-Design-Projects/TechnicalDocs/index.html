                        Proper preparation and responsible judgment greatly reduce the probability of encountering an emergency situation, but even with the most careful precautions emergencies may still occur from time to time.

                <li>Parachute Malfunctions (General)
                    <ol>
                        <li>The majority of all malfunctions can be traced to three primary causes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>poor or unstable body position during parachute deployment</li>
                                <li>faulty equipment</li>
                                <li>improper or careless packing</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Malfunction procedures:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Refer to Category A of the Integrated Student Program for specific, basic procedures for dealing with parachute malfunctions.</li>
                                <li>In addition, other procedures are discussed in this section for licensed jumpers who may need to adjust procedures to accommodate different techniques, equipment, and personal preferences.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>All malfunctions can be classified as one of two types:
                            <ul>
                                <li>total malfunction (parachute not activated, or activated but not deploying)</li>
                                <li>partial malfunction (parachute deployed but not landable)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You should decide upon and take the appropriate actions by a predetermined altitude:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Students and A-license holders: 2,500 feet.</li>
                                <li>B-D license holders: 1,800 feet.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Reserve activation
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reserve pilot chutes are manufactured with a metal spring in the center, which adds weight to the reserve pilot chute.</li>
                                <li>During a stable, belly-to-earth reserve deployment, the reserve pilot chute can remain in the jumper’s burble for several seconds, delaying the reserve deployment.</li>
                                <li>Immediately after pulling the reserve ripcord, look over your right shoulder while twisting your upper body upwards to the right, or sit up in a slightly head-high orientation, in order to change the airflow behind your
                                    container to help the reserve pilot chute launch into clean air.</li>
                                <li>Most harness and container manufacturers secure the steering toggles to reserve risers using Velcro, which will firmly hold the toggle in place. Be sure to peel the Velcro before attempting to pull the toggles free from
                                    the risers to release the brakes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Total Malfunction

                        <li>Identification

                                <li>A total malfunction includes deployment handle problems (unable to locate or extract the main parachute deployment handle), pack closure, and a pilot chute in tow.</li>
                                <li>If altitude permits, the jumper should make no more than two attempts to solve the problem (or a total of no more than two additional seconds).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Malfunction Procedures:
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the case of no main pilot chute deployment (e.g., missing or stuck handle, ripcord system container lock), deploy the reserve.</li>
                                <li>hand-deployed pilot chute in tow malfunction procedures (choose one):
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>For a pilot-chute-in-tow malfunction, there are currently two common and acceptable procedures, both of which have pros and cons.</li>
                                        <li>An instructor should be consulted prior to gearing up, and each skydiver should have a pre-determined course of action:
                                            <ul>
                                                <code>
                                                    <li>Pilot chute in tow procedure 1:
                                                        <p>Pull the reserve immediately. A pilot-chute-in-tow malfunction is associated with a high descent rate and requires immediate action. The chance of a mainreserve entanglement is slim, and valuable time and altitude could be lost by initiating a cutaway prior to deploying the reserve. Be prepared to cutaway.</p>
                                                    </li>
                                                </code>

                                                    <li>Pilot chute in tow procedure 2:
                                                        <p>Cut away, then immediately deploy the reserve. Because there is a chance the main parachute could deploy during or as a result of the reserve activation, a cutaway might be the best response in some situations.
                                                        </p>

                                        <li>In some cases, the parachute system used for the jump will require specific procedures that must be followed to reduce the chances of a main/reserve entanglement if the main canopy deploys after the reserve parachute
                                            is deployed. Check with the manufacturer of your harness and container for any specific procedures.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                <li>Partial Malfunction (General)
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identification: A partial malfunction is characterized by deployment (removal from the container) or partial deployment of the main parachute and includes horseshoe (the container is open but the parachute is not properly deployed
                            because something is snagged on the system), bag lock, streamer, lineover, line pressure knots, major (unlandable) canopy damage, and other open-canopy malfunctions.</li>
                        <li>Procedure: The recommended procedure for responding to partial malfunctions is to cut away the main parachute before deploying the reserve.</li>
                        <li>At some point during descent under a partial malfunction, it becomes too low for a safe cutaway and you must deploy the reserve without cutting away.</li>
                        <li>Consider the operating range of the automatic activation device when determining your personal malfunction response altitudes</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Premature Main Container Opening
                            <ul>
                                <li>With a throw-out main pilot-chute deployment system (pilot chute deployment prior to closing pin extraction), the container can open before the pilot chute is deployed, causing one type of horseshoe malfunction.</li>
                                <li>Prevention
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>good equipment and closing system maintenance</li>
                                        <li>careful movement in the aircraft and during climbout and exit</li>
                                        <li>avoiding jumper contact that involves the main closing system</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Upon discovery that the main container has opened, the recommended response is as follows:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>First, attempt to deploy the main pilot chute for no more than two tries or two seconds, whichever comes first.</li>
                                        <li>Failing that, cut away and deploy the reserve.</li>
                                        <li>Out-of-sequence pilot-chute extraction:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>On systems with a bottom-of-container mounted pilot chute, premature extraction of the bag prior to pilot-chute deployment may make the pilot chute difficult to locate and extract.</li>
                                                <li>On any throw-out hand-deployed system, the pilot chute should be capable of extraction by the jumper or from tension on the main bridle caused by the deployed parachute in the event of this type of malfunction.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Two Canopies Out
                            <p>Various scenarios can result in having both parachutes deploy with one of the following outcomes.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>One canopy inflated, another deploying
                                    <ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Procedures for an unintentional water landing:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Continue to steer to avoid the water hazard.</li>
                                <li>Activate the flotation device, if available.</li>
                                <li>Disconnect the chest strap to facilitate getting out of the harness after landing in the water.</li>
                                <li>Disconnect the reserve static line (if applicable) to reduce complications in case the main needs to be cut away after splashing down.</li>
                                <li>Steer into the wind.</li>
                                <li>Loosen the leg straps slightly to facilitate getting out of the harness after splashing down.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If you loosen the leg straps too much, you may not be able to reach the toggles.</li>
                                        <li>Do not unfasten the leg straps until you have landed and your feet are in the water</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Flare to half brakes at ten feet above the water (this may be difficult to judge, due to poor depth perception over the water).</li>
                                <li>Prepare for a PLF, in case the water is shallow (it will be nearly impossible to determine the depth from above).</li>
                                <li>Enter the water with your lungs filled with air.</li>
                                <li>After entering the water, throw your arms back and slide forward out of the harness.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Remain in the harness and attached to the canopy until actually in the water.</li>
                                        <li>If cutting away (known deep water only), do so only after both feet contact the water</li>
                                        <li>If flotation gear is not used, separation from the equipment is essential.</li>
                                        <li>The container can also serve as a flotation device if the reserve canopy is packed in the container</li>
                                        <li>Caution must be used to avoid the main canopy suspension lines if the reserve container is used for flotation.</li>
                                        <li>Tests have shown that a container with a packed reserve will remain buoyant for up to 45 minutes or longer.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Dive deep and swim out from under the collapsed canopy.</li>
                                <li>If covered by the canopy, follow one seam to the edge of the canopy until clear of it.</li>
                                <li>In swift or shallow water, pull one toggle in or cut away if under the main canopy.</li>
                                <li>Refill your lungs at every opportunity.</li>
                                <li>Swim carefully away upwind or upstream to avoid entangling in the suspension lines.</li>
                                <li>Remove any full coverage helmets in the event of breathing difficulties.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>If using the Air Force type (LPU) underarm flotation equipment:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Although worn underneath, the bladders inflate outside the harness, so removal of the harness is not practical without first deflating the bladders.</li>
                                <li>If you must remove the harness after landing, the bladders should be deflated, extricated from the harness, and reinflated (orally) one at a time.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The risks of a water landing are greatly increased when a jumper wears additional weights to increase fall rate.</li>
                        <li>Camera flyers, skysurfers, and other skydivers carrying additional equipment on a jump need to plan their water landing procedures accordingly.</li>
                        <li>Water temperature must always be a consideration:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Water temperatures below 70 degrees Fahrenheit can severely limit the amount of time a person can survive while trying to tread water or remain afloat.</li>
                                <li>Treading water or swimming will cause the body to lose heat more rapidly, because blood moves to the extremities and is then cooled more rapidly.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the situation, it may be better to try to float rather than swim or tread water while waiting for help to arrive.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Drop any ripcords or other objects.</li>
                                <li>Bring a ram-air canopy to slow flight.</li>
                                <li>With a round canopy, place your hands between the front and rear risers on each side.</li>
                                <li>Prepare for a PLF with your feet and knees tightly together and turn your head to the side to protect your chin.</li>
                                <li>Land parallel to the power lines.</li>

                                        <li>Wait for help from drop zone and power company personnel; nylon conducts electricity at higher voltages.</li>

                        <li>The potential dangers of landing in a tree extend until you are rescued and safely on the ground.</li>
                        <li>. Make any low-altitude avoidance turns from braked flight to avoid an equally dangerous dive following a turn from full flight.</li>

                                <li>. Don’t attempt to climb down from a tree without competent assistance (rescue personnel or properly trained drop zone staff).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The best way to avoid a collision is to know where other canopies are at all times.</li>
                <li>Most canopy collisions occur soon after deployment when two jumpers open too close to each other, or below 1,000 feet while in the landing pattern.</li>
                <li>Higher break-off altitudes, better planning and tracking farther can help ensure clear airspace during deployment.
                </li>
                <li>Remaining vigilant throughout the canopy descent and always looking in the direction of the turn before initiating it can help to identify and avoid other canopies during the descent.</li>
                <li>If approaching a jumper head on, both canopies should steer to the right unless it is obvious that steering left is necessary to avoid the collision (both jumpers are more offset towards the left).</li>
                <li>If a collision is inevitable:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Protect your face and operation handles.</li>
                        <li>Tuck in your arms, legs and head for protection against the impact.</li>
                        <li>Avoid hitting the suspension lines of the other canopy or the other jumper, if at all possible.</li>
                        <li>If a collision with the other jumper’s suspension lines is unavoidable, it may be possible to spread your legs and one arm, while protecting your handles with the other arm, in order to keep from passing through the suspension
                            lines during the collision. However, a collision at high speed with suspension lines can lead to severe cuts and burns.</li>
                        <li>Check altitude with respect to the minimum cutaway decision and execution altitude recommended for your experience.</li>
                        <li>Communicate before taking action:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The jumper above can strike the jumper below during a cutaway unless one or both are clear or ready to fend off.</li>
                                <li>The jumper below can worsen the situation for the jumper above by cutting away before he or she is ready.</li>
                                <li>If both jumpers are cutting away and altitude permits, the second jumper should wait until the first jumper clears the area below.</li>
                                <li>The first jumper should fly from underneath in a straight line after opening.</li>
                                <li>At some point below a safe cutaway altitude (1,000 feet), it may become necessary to deploy one or both reserves (may not be a safe option with an SOS system).</li>
                                <li>If both jumpers are suspended under one flying canopy at a low altitude, it may become necessary to land with only that canopy.</li>
                                <li>Communications may be difficult if one or both jumpers are wearing full-face helmets.</li>

                <li>Low turns under canopy are one of the biggest causes of serious injury and death in skydiving.</li>
                <li>A low turn can be premeditated or result from an error in judgment or experience with a situation.</li>
                <li>To avoid low turns, fly to a large, uncrowded landing area free of obstacles and:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fly a planned landing pattern that promotes a cooperative traffic flow.</li>
                        <li>If landing off-field, plan a landing pattern by 1,000 feet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once a jumper realizes that a turn has been made at an unsafe altitude:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use toggle control to get the canopy back overhead and stop the turn.</li>
                        <li>Stop the dive.</li>
                        <li>Flare and prepare for a hard landing (PLF).</li>
                        <li>Manage the speed induced by the turn:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Expect more responsive flare control with the toggles due to the increased airspeed.</li>
                                <li>Expect a longer, flatter flare.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In case of premature contact with the ground, no matter how hard, keep flying the canopy to reduce further injury.</li>
