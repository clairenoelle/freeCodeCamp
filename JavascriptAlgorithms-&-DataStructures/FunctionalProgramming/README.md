# Learn About Functional Programming

The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.



# Understand Functional Programming Terminology

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.



# Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.



# Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

Let's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies.

Write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then increases the value by one.



# Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

Refactor (rewrite) the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of an array. The remove function should remove the given bookName from an array. Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName one.



# Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use map to pull the title and rating from watchList and save the new array in the rating variable. The code in the editor currently uses a for loop to do this, replace the loop functionality with your map expression.
