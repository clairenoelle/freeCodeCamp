# Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push

Change the nonMutatingPush function so it uses concat to add newItem to the end of original instead of push. The function should return an array.



# Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs

Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:

The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words

The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)

The output should be all lower-cased letters

The output should not have any spaces



# Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.



# Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method

Use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, "I-like-Star-Wars" would be converted to "I like Star Wars". For this challenge, do not use the replace method.



# Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method

Use the concat method in the nonMutatingConcat function to concatenate attach to the end of original. The function should return the concatenated array.



# Implement map on a Prototype

Write your own Array.prototype.myMap(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.map(). You may use a for loop or the forEach method.



# Implement the filter Method on a Prototype

Write your own Array.prototype.myFilter(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.filter(). You may use a for loop or the Array.prototype.forEach() method.



# Introduction to Currying and Partial Application

Fill in the body of the add function so it uses currying to add parameters x, y, and z.



# Learn About Functional Programming

The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.



# Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

Let's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies.

Write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then increases the value by one.



# Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

Refactor (rewrite) the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of an array. The remove function should remove the given bookName from an array. Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName one.



# Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice

Rewrite the function nonMutatingSplice by using slice instead of splice. It should limit the provided cities array to a length of 3, and return a new array with only the first three items.

Do not mutate the original array provided to the function.



# Return a Sorted Array Without Changing the Original Array

Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.



# Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method

Use the slice method in the sliceArray function to return part of the anim array given the provided beginSlice and endSlice indices. The function should return an array.



# Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method

Use the sort method in the alphabeticalOrder function to sort the elements of arr in alphabetical order.



# Split a String into an Array Using the split Method

Use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.



# Understand Functional Programming Terminology

Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.



# Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria

Use the every method inside the checkPositive function to check if every element in arr is positive. The function should return a Boolean value.



# Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map to return a new array of objects with only title and rating keys, but where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may want to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.



# Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use map to pull the title and rating from watchList and save the new array in the rating variable. The code in the editor currently uses a for loop to do this, replace the loop functionality with your map expression.



# Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use reduce to find the average IMDB rating of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan. Recall from prior challenges how to filter data and map over it to pull what you need. You may need to create other variables, but save the final average into the variable averageRating. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and need to be converted into numbers before they are used in any mathematical operations.



# Use the some Method to Check that Any Elements in an Array Meet a Criteria

Use the some method inside the checkPositive function to check if any element in arr is positive. The function should return a Boolean value.
