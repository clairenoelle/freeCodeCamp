# Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.



# Understanding Uninitialized Variables

Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.



# Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.

# Declare String Variables

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.



# Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".



# Quoting Strings with Single Quotes

Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.

Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.



# Escape Sequences in Strings

Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine

You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.

Here is the text with the escape sequences written out.

"FirstLine newline tab backslash SecondLine newline ThirdLine"



# Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

Build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.



# Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: "This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.



# Constructing Strings with Variables

Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"



# Appending Variables to Strings

Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.



# Find the Length of a String

Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.



# Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.



# Understand String Immutability

Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.



# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.



#  Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.



# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.



# Word Blanks

In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the result variable.

You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.

The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.



# Understanding Boolean Values

Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.



# Use Conditional Logic with If Statements

Create an if statement inside the function to return "Yes, that was true" if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return "No, that was false" otherwise.



# Comparison with the Equality Operator

Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when val is equivalent to 12



# Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator

Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return "Equal" when val is strictly equal to 7

Write chained if/else if statements to fulfill the following conditions:

num < 5 - return "Tiny"
num < 10 - return "Small"
num < 15 - return "Medium"
num < 20 - return "Large"
num >= 20 - return "Huge"



# Golf Code

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	Return
1	"Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	"Birdie"
par	"Par"
par + 1	"Bogey"

# Counting Cards


Count Change Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Output
-3 Hold
5 Bet



# Build JavaScript Objects

Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.



# Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation

# Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation

Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.



# Accessing Object Properties with Variables

Use the playerNumber variable to look up player 16 in testObj using bracket notation. Then assign that name to the player variable.



# Updating Object Properties

Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from "Coder" to "Happy Coder". You can use either dot or bracket notation.



# Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object

Add a "bark" property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.



# Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object

Delete the "tails" property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.



# Using Objects for Lookups

Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable.



# Testing Objects for Properties

Modify the function checkObj to test myObj for checkProp. If the property is found, return that property's value. If not, return "Not Found".
