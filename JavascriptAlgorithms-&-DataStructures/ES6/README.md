# Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords

Fix the code so that i declared in the if statement is a separate variable than i declared in the first line of the function. Be certain not to use the var keyword anywhere in your code.

This exercise is designed to illustrate the difference between how var and let keywords assign scope to the declared variable. When programming a function similar to the one used in this exercise, it is often better to use different variable names to avoid confusion.



# Create an Export Fallback with export default

The following function should be the fallback value for the module. Please add the necessary code to do so.



# Create Strings using Template Literals

Use template literal syntax with backticks to display each entry of the result object's failure array. Each entry should be wrapped inside an li element with the class attribute text-warning, and listed within the resultDisplayArray.



# Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices, meaning constants should be in all caps.



# Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords

Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.



# Import a Default Export

In the following code, please import the default export, subtract, from the file "math_functions", found in the same directory as this file.



# Mutate an Array Declared with const

An array is declared as const s = [5, 7, 2]. Change the array to [2, 5, 7] using various element assignment.



# Prevent Object Mutation

In this challenge you are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. You need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties .



# Set Default Parameters for Your Functions

Modify the function increment by adding default parameters so that it will add 1 to number if value is not specified.



# Understand the Differences Between import and require

Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the capitalizeString function. The file where this function lives is called "string_functions", and it is in the same directory as the current file.



# Use * to Import Everything from a File

The code below requires the contents of a file, "capitalize_strings", found in the same directory as it, imported. Add the appropriate import * statement to the top of the file, using the object provided.



# Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() to use arrow function syntax. Also make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.



#  Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

Use class keyword and write a proper constructor to create the Vegetable class.

The Vegetable lets you create a vegetable object, with a property name, to be passed to constructor.



# Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays

Use destructuring assignment to swap the values of a and b so that a receives the value stored in b, and b receives the value stored in a.



# Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects

Use destructuring assignment to obtain max of forecast.tomorrow and assign it to maxOfTomorrow.



# Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects

Use destructuring to obtain the average temperature for tomorrow from the input object AVG_TEMPERATURES, and assign value with key tomorrow to tempOfTomorrow in line.



# Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function half to send only max and min inside the function.



# Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Operator to Reassign Array Elements

Use destructuring assignment with the rest operator to perform an effective Array.prototype.slice() so that arr is a sub-array of the original array source with the first two elements omitted.



# Use export to Reuse a Code Block

Below are two variables that I want to make available for other files to use. Utilizing the first way I demonstrated export, export the two variables.



# Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object

Use class keyword to create a Thermostat class. The constructor accepts Fahrenheit temperature.

Now create getter and setter in the class, to obtain the temperature in Celsius scale.

Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value of temperature in Fahrenheit scale, and C is the value of the same temperature in Celsius scale

Note

When you implement this, you would be tracking the temperature inside the class in one scale - either Fahrenheit or Celsius.

This is the power of getter or setter - you are creating an API for another user, who would get the correct result, no matter which one you track.

In other words, you are abstracting implementation details from the consumer.



# Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters

Modify the function sum so that it uses the rest operator and it works in the same way with any number of parameters.



# Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place

Copy all contents of arr1 into another array arr2 using the spread operator.



#  Write Arrow Functions with Parameters

Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.



# Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6

Refactor the function setGear inside the object bicycle to use the shorthand syntax described above.



# Write Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Simple Fields

Use simple fields with object literals to create and return a Person object.



# Write Higher Order Arrow Functions

Use arrow function syntax to compute the square of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) in the array realNumberArray and store the new array in the variable squaredIntegers.
