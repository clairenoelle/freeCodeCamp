# Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function

The function raiseToPower raises a base to an exponent. Unfortunately, it's not called properly - fix the code so the value of power is the expected 8.



# Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call

Fix the code so the variable result is set to the value returned from calling the function getNine.



# Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names

Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the netWorkingCapital calculation works.



# Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes

Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the href value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.



# Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing

Fix the two indexing errors in the following function so all the numbers 1 through 5 are printed to the console.



# Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

Fix the two pair errors in the code.



# Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator

Fix the condition so the program runs the right branch, and the appropriate value is assigned to result.



# Prevent Infinite Loops with a Valid Terminal Condition

The myFunc() function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition i != 4 will never evaluate to false (and break the looping) - i will increment by 2 each pass, and jump right over 4 since i is odd to start. Fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition so the loop only runs for i less than or equal to 4.



# Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

Use console.log() to print the variables in the code where indicated.



# Use Caution When Reinitializing Variables Inside a Loop

The following function is supposed to create a two-dimensional array with m rows and n columns of zeroes. Unfortunately, it's not producing the expected output because the row variable isn't being reinitialized (set back to an empty array) in the outer loop. Fix the code so it returns a correct 3x2 array of zeroes, which looks like [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]].



# Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

Use the console.log() method to print the value of the variable a where noted in the code.



# Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.
